# 5_Day_Forecast README

## Intoduction
This is the README for the 5 Day Forecast of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains an HTML, CSS, and JS file for a website that uses APIs to get the weather predicted from the city searched. The API was supplied to me by the bootcamp.

## Things Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn how to use javascript to make API fetch requests for data, as well as how to store data for later use or even for use in creating responsive buttons. I also used bootstrap for the first time in a project, which I liked quite a bit, as it made creating the webpage with some rudimentary styling so much easier.
